# **Part 1: About Us.**

## **This is our team.**

 We are **The Nocturnalist**, team from Bangkok, Thailand. We are a part of YB-Robot club from Yothinburana School with our mentor, Punnapon Tanasnitikul. This is our club website https://ybrobot.club/. The club was established in 2009 with the first name being “YB Dream Team”. Last year, we also attend in WRO 2023 that took place in Panama.
 <hr>

### **Team History** 
 
 Our team name "The Nocturnalists" are what is called “night owls”. We tend to work mostly at night because we find ourselves more focused and active once it gets dark. An owl, is also a symbol of wisdom and knowledge. It consists of the word "Nocturnal", which means animals well known for being active during nighttime, with the suffix "-ist" indicating someone who practices or specializes in something. Like us, we love to work during nighttime.

The name The Nocturnalist starts from our senior since the year 2015 in FLL Asia Pacific competition that took place in Australia. They won first place in national and got the Innovation Solution Award in international stage.</p>
 This is the first generation.

</p>
  </p>
  </p>
This is the second generation that use this name. They compete in FLL competion national stage 2021. Due to the well known disease "COVID-19" making the competition online. They perform well and place first. The project used a lot of resource which take numerous people from our club. </p>
This is the second generation.

</p>
  </p> 
  </p>
Currently in 2024, we are a part of the third generation. This name has been used before by our senior, and because of its meaning. So, we decided to use it again. And by using it, there is a responsibility since our senior perform excellently. We are hoping to keep this name on the winning streak and make them proud. </p>
This is the third generation

### **Our Team**
   The team consists of three intimate friends Pawit Nateenantasawasd, Pongpapat Putongkam, and Thanyawut Krittikanon. We have been together for four years, forming a strong bond that enhances our collaborative efforts. We first met in high school, sharing the same class, and after some conversation, we discovered our similarities. For instance, we both share a passion for robotics and competition, which led us to join the YB-Robot club together. Much of what we know today has been learned from the experiences of our seniors, who have taught us valuable lessons and helped shape who we are now. This journey has brought us to this international stage.

   Last year, with great enthusiasm and high spirits, we joined the WRO. Reaching the international round was already a great honor, but we were soon to realize that in order to win, one needs more than just enthusiasm. Our mistakes led us take the 8th position, a respectable position indeed. 

   This year, we are back with greater confidence, and wiser from past experiences. We honed our strategies and prepared extensively. We fixed every mistake we have done last year and more. Being back at the international stage is one of our dreams. And we are here to make everyone proud.  


<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Book2009/FE-NOC/blob/main/Team-Photos/Formal.png" width="500"/>
</p>

<hr>
There are three members in our team, all extremely focused and dedicated to their positions, performing functions as follows: 
 
#### 1. Thanyawut Krittikanon – Team Coordinator And Document Designer
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Book2009/FE-NOC/blob/main/Team-Photos/Members/Thanyawut%20Krittikanon.png" width="400"/>
</p>
Thanyawut is in charge of documentation. He possesses both robotics and programming skills which helps him assist us in keeping our processes organized. He also ensures that every procedure and system we work on is accurately done correctly, helping us maintain a clear workflow. This will not only enable us to move forward to the next stage but to also improve on the stages we have gone through.

#### 2. Pawit Nateenantasawasd – The Programmer 
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Book2009/FE-NOC/blob/main/Team-Photos/Members/Pawit%20Nateenantasawasd.png" width="400"/>
</p>
This is Pawit, our talented coder. He specialize in multiple coding language such as C++, C, Python, Micropython, HTML, etc. He may seem quiet at first, but his personality contributes to his work on coding “puzzles” in a very accurate and neat manner. It is his ability to focus which allows him to take up the challenge of programming very complicated systems like ours. It is this concentration that in the end enables us to have robots that work perfectly well. Pawit is always busy, it seems, and his engagement is what makes this group effective. 

#### 3. Pongpapat Putongkam – The Mechanic And Constructor
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/ThanyawutII/Test/blob/main/Pongpapat_Putongkam.png" width="400"/>
</p>
We have Pongpapat, our resident robotic designer who is stereotypically imaginative. He is responsible for our robot by designing it with both 3D and Lego parts. He uses Blender to design our 3D robot model. Sometimes, he built a Lego robot chassis to test if the new components work before he starts to design it in 3D parts. He also has an ability to form ideas quite literally out of nothing. He can picture the idea of the design in his mind, it is easy to take the ideas and put it into a design that is eye catching and unique.  

</p>

### **Our Vision And Goal**

We want to create a robot that can operate similarly to a self-driving car, with the hope of integrating it with an actual automobile. This competition is the first step toward our future goal of helping our country and inventing new things. Additionally, via participating in this competition, we have developed and learned numerous skills like collaboration, imagination, and foresight. We also desired to meet new friends from other nations in order to exchange cultures. Furthermore, we intend to utilize the experience we have obtained from this tournament to better ourselves and mentor our junior at school.
<hr>

### **Work Schedule**

We created a thorough work plan demonstrating our devotion and cooperation and strategic planning skills. these are the well-defined people as well as deadlines that make sure that every individual in the team understands what is expected of them and by when. Setting priorities and milestones also help in effective time management, progress tracking and coping up with any unplanned activities. This approach boosts productivity in addition to teamwork as one can focus on the task at hand without risking wandering away. The plan we created is a guiding document that speeds us up and provides us with accuracy in achieving success.

# **Part 2: MECHANICAL DESIGN**

## Robot's Chassis


<img align="right" width="450" src="https://github.com/ThanyawutII/Test/blob/main/render%20to%20board%201-min.gif">

The robot chassis design consists mainly of the 3D printed parts, which provide a strong support for all the hardware and electronics devices. Each element is custom-designed to meet our specific requirements and interlocks seamlessly to create a lightweight yet resilient structure. Modification and extension of the orthotics and bambulab 3D-printed chassis is made easily due to its modular construction. It is designed to house the motors, electronic circuitry, and battery while enhancing thermal management and balanced weight distribution for efficient operation. This strategy not only allows for fast modeling and changes in design, but it also makes it easy if an operational change requires that some parts should be removed or replaced with better ones as the robot matures. [All the 3D printable models can be found here](https://github.com/Book2009/Nocturnalist-Future-Engineers/tree/main/3D_Models).

  </tr>
</table>

The main base provides the foundation for creating all other parts. It has cylindrical extensions meant to attach the servo and motor too — designed with LEGO connectors in mind, as opposed to clunky black pegs. medium Also detailed are the openings to accommodate both differential gear and regular gears so they do not hit the base when trying to rotate. One is a specially designed slot to work with this 3D-printed differential gear mount. The front part is cut out deeper so the servo for steering fits inside and has no problems to spin freely. This design allows to move effectively and optics in the small space of the robot.

<hr>

### Support Base

<table align="center">
  <tr>
    <td align="center">

This component is very important for supporting the differential gear firmly and creating solidity to the drivetrain of our robot. Among the basic choices that we made during the work on the robot design, one of the key decisions was not to use bolts and nuts. This reduction in weight is achieved by using ABS plastic filament instead of steel, which is significantly lighter. This choice not only decreases the overall weight but also simplifies the assembly by requiring fewer additional elements and connections.

<p align="center">
<img width="400" src="https://github.com/ThanyawutII/Test-2/blob/main/a0c387ff-fb17-4383-9e34-803489d1c718.png">

A lighter robot just provides enhanced mobility and more efficiency, which is a crucial factor given the requirements of competitively in the competition. In order to attain a most stringent connection to the main base an interlocking joint was implemented. This design helps in assembling by minimizing the use of conventional fasteners during the construction process. 

<p align="center">
<img width="350" src="https://github.com/ThanyawutII/Test-2/blob/main/Screenshot%202024-10-28%20163905.png">  <img width="390" src="https://github.com/ThanyawutII/Test-2/blob/main/Wood-Joints-fdf0ae5b6e2c40438e6800fe91fe2733.png"> 
  
From this connection, we developed cylindrical formings which work more like bolts, used to place the parts in right position as well as fix them in place.

<p align="center">
<img width="300" src="https://github.com/ThanyawutII/Test-2/blob/main/Screenshot%202024-10-28%20105711.png">

Made for added security, precision grooves feature with special C-clips that serve as a replacement for nuts, designed to fit seamlessly. These C-clips are held firmly in place within specially designed grooves that prevent any movement. The groove area has a smaller diameter than the other sections, which ensures a tight fit, preventing any up-and-down motion. The only way to release the C-clip would be to pull it sideways, making the design stable and secure.

<p align="center">

- #### **Filament** : Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene or simply known as ***ABS**
<image src="https://github.com/Book2009/FE-NOC/blob/main/Robot-Photos/Robot%20Parts/3D/ABS%20Filament.png" width = "400">
ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) is probably the most common filament used in 3D printing. It is especially valuable in strong plastic parts that must remain resilient in the face of temperature swings. It is mainly used in FDM (fused deposition modeling) 3D printers. ABS is a thermoplastic polymer composed of three monomers: acrylonitrile, butadiene, and styrene. The material was first patented in the 1940s and very quickly gained popularity.

<image src="https://github.com/Book2009/FE-NOC/blob/main/Robot-Photos/Robot%20Parts/Movement/Motor.png" width = "400">
It's a simple motor, and we chose this motor because of its easy connection to our robot and its cost-effectiveness. This motor is small yet powerful. and it is the perfect size for our robot. The motor comes with a dedicated port for Lego. So, we modified it to make it able to connect to the board. 

##### Electrical Specifications

- #### **Servo** : GEEKSERVO 2kg 360 Degrees Servo.
<image src="https://github.com/Book2009/FE-NOC/blob/main/Robot-Photos/Robot%20Parts/Movement/servo.png" width = "400">
We use this servo for steering the robot and employ an ultrasonic sensor for rotation. This servo is compatible with LEGO, making it easy and convenient to build the robot by just putting studs in the hole on the side. We like how you can connect two axles to the dual outputs on this servo so you can power two wheels or gears, or mount the servo securely inside articulated limbs and other contraptions. Additionally, the gears inside these servos will 'slip' when the blocking load is too high instead of jamming, helping avoid damage to your servos and boards.

The wires are a standard servo pinout - 
-	Red - positive
-	Brown - negative
-	Yellow - data

This part ensure that both wheels have the power from the motor, which makes the robot drive forward. This part has gear teeth on the side, which are connected to the gear we put on the motor earlier, and then we put 3 small gears inside the differential. The differential is attached to the main body using an axle from the wheel.

There are a lot of wheels to select. We chose this one because of it's size. If the wheels are too small, it reduces the speed due to the lack of rotation. But if the wheels are too big, it makes the robot slower and harder to control. With the combination of the motor and the wheels, the robot can maintain the speed we can control.

<img src = "https://github.com/Book2009/FE-NOC/blob/main/Robot-Photos/Robot%20Parts/Controller/Arduino%20Mega.png" width = "400">
This part is like a brain of our body. It's job is to store all the program of our robot from the computer, every components in the robot comes through here. We chose this board because of it's connection port, it contains tons of ports that we want such as 3 UART port. We used Arduino Uno last year, but the problem is there's not enough port for OpenMV and GY-25. But there's some disadvantage in this board. Because this board has a lot of connection port, it comes with weight and size. It's almost 2 times longer than the UNO. And that makes the robot long and heavy.

Additional information about UART:
UART operates by transmitting data as a series of bits, including a start bit, data bits, an optional parity bit, and stop bit(s). Unlike parallel communication, where multiple bits are transmitted simultaneously, UART sends data serially, one bit at a time. As the name reveals the protocol operates asynchronous which means that it doesn't rely on a shared clock signal. Instead, it uses predefined baud rates to determine the timing of data bits.

- #### **Touch Sensor** : ZX-Switch01 by INEX
This button gives us an easier way to start the robot. Since the controller board doesn't come with switches. So we found this button that could be attached to the frame outside the board using bolt.

- #### **On/Off Switch** : SPST ON/OFF Switch 2 Pin Rocker Switch DC 125/250V
This switch is for cutting the power from the battery to the robot. The regulation states that before starting the robot, the power must be cut off. That's when this switch came in. To use this switch we solder red wire(Positive pole) to the switch on 1 side for input. Then another solder red wire for output on the opposite side. You can put the black wire(Negative pole) straight into the step down. When the switch is turned on, the power from the battery will direct into the stepdown and then the robot. Additionally, we have designed a protective case for this switch to ensure safety and durability. [You can view the 3D model here](https://github.com/Book2009/FE-NOC/blob/main/3D_Models/Switch%20Box.stl).

- #### **Step-down** : HW-360 V6.0
This is a step-down DC-DC module. It comes with a status indicator light, a display screen that shows the voltage meter, and self-calibration of the voltage meter. The electrical voltage has an error of 0.05 V, with a measuring range of 0–40 V. We need this step down to show us how long until we need to recharge the battery.

<image src="https://github.com/ThanyawutII/Test/blob/main/Screenshot_2024-10-22_112329-removebg-preview.png" width = "400">
The battery provides the power for our robot. This battery enhances the operation of the robot since a higher voltage is attained thereby reducing the current draw and consequently power loss during operation of the battery. It also makes for consistency and continuous customer service without experiencing low voltage slight especially at high current loads. This makes the team feel confident during practice and competition.

# **Part 3: Obstacle Management**

## Open Challenge rounds

In this round, our robot must complete three(3) laps on the track with random placements of the inside track walls within 3 minutes.

- #### **The strategy**

In this Open Challenge rounds, the robot will use the ultrasonic to measure the distance of the robot from the outer wall. The robot will use the color sensor to check the line color. If the first color is red, the robot will turn right, and if it’s blue, the robot will turn left(because if the robot has to turn right, it will detect the red line first, and if it has to turn left, it will detect the blue line first, using different color sensors for detecting each line color). Every time, the robot will check how many times it has crossed the first line. It will count 12 lines(1 round = 4 lines), and after that, it will walk with the timer that we set until the time we set runs out.

## Obstacle Challenge rounds

<image src="https://github.com/ThanyawutII/Test/blob/main/OpenChallengeMain%20(1).jpg" width = "400">
In this round, our robot must complete three laps on a track marked with randomly placed green and red traffic signs.
<br>
● Red Pillar: Keep to the right side of the lane.
<br>
● Green Pillar: Keep to the left side of the lane.
<br>
The last traffic sign in the second round indicates the next move: a green sign means continue in the same direction for the third round, while a red sign requires turning around to complete the round in the opposite direction. The robot must not move any traffic signs. After finishing the three laps, the robot must find a parking lot and perform parallel parking.
