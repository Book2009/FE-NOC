# **About Us.**

### **This is our team.**



  We are **Nocturnalist**. We are a team from Bangkok, Thailand. The word **Nocturnalist** is from our behavior. It refers to a person who thrives or operates during the night. It consists of the word "Nocturnal", which means animals or people active during nighttime, with the suffix "-ist" indicating someone who practices or specializes in something. Like us, we love to work during nighttime. Our team consists of three members: Pongpapat Putongkam, Pawit Nateenantasawasd, and Thanyawut Krittikanon. Designer, Programmer, and Supporter respectively. We have been good friends for 4 years, so we know how to work together very well. In our first attempt at this WRO category last year, we earned the opportunity to compete in the international round. But we are not careful enough, our rookie mistake gets us only in 8th place. This year, we’re returning to correct the mistakes we made last year, confident that we’ll perform even better.

  Our team has 3 major positions. Firstly, Pawit Nateenantasawasd (the middle person). He is the programmer of our team. He is quite introverted so he can focus for a very long time. On the other hand, Pongpapat Putongkam (the left person). He has a very short attention span, so he could come up with new ideas easily. He is the designer and builder of our robot. Lastly, Thanyawut Krittikanon (the right person). He is at the best of both worlds. He can program and design, so he is a supporter of the team. Our team name is YBR-BOK. 'YBR' stands for 'Yothinburana Robot Club', and 'BOK' comes from our nickname 'Book, O'ly, Kaopun'.


# **Part 1: MECHANICAL DEESIGN**

Last year, our design was based entirely on Lego. This year we decided to up our game and 3d print the whole thing with ABS and PLA plastic filament reinforced with metal parts and some Lego. Using 3d printed parts allows more flexibility to be implemented and makes it easy to acquire spare parts for an emergency.
Even with all of that, we will still use Lego parts to connect in a very precise area.


## Robot's Chassis

The chassis of our robot, primarily constructed from 3D-printed components, forms a robust foundation for all hardware and electronics. Each part is custom-designed to meet our specific requirements and interlocks seamlessly to create a lightweight yet resilient structure. The modular design of the 3D-printed chassis allows for straightforward customization and scalability. It is engineered to accommodate motors, electronics, and the battery, ensuring proper heat dissipation and balanced weight distribution for optimal performance. This approach not only enables rapid prototyping and iterative design but also simplifies part replacement and upgrades as the robot evolves.
