# **Part 1: About Us.**

## **This is our team.**

 We are **The Nocturnalist**, team from Bangkok, Thailand. We are a part of YB-Robot club from Yothinburana School with our mentor, Punnapon Tanasnitikul. This is our club website https://ybrobot.club/. The club was established in 2009 with the first name being “YB Dream Team”. Last year, we also attend in WRO 2023 that took place in Panama.

### **Team History** 
 
 Our team name "Nocturnalists" are what is called “night owls”. We tend to work mostly at night because we find ourselves more focused and active once it gets dark. An owl, is also a symbol of wisdom and knowledge. It consists of the word "Nocturnal", which means animals well known for being active during nighttime, with the suffix "-ist" indicating someone who practices or specializes in something. Like us, we love to work during nighttime.

The name Nocturnalist starts from our senior since the year 2015 in FLL Asia Pacific competition that took place in Australia. They won first place in national and got the Innovation Solution Award in international stage.</p>
 This is the first generation.

</p>
  </p>
  </p>
This is the second generation that use this name. They compete in FLL competion national stage 2021. Due to the well known disease "COVID-19" making the competition online. They perform well and place first. The project used a lot of resource which take numerous people from our club. </p>
This is the second generation.

</p>
  </p> 
  </p>
Currently in 2024, we are a part of the third generation. This name has been used before by our senior, and because of its meaning. So, we decided to use it again. And by using it, there is a responsibility since our senior perform excellently. We are hoping to keep this name on the winning streak and make them proud. </p>
This is the third generation

### **Our Team**
   The team consists of three intimate friends Pawit Nateenantasawasd, Pongpapat Putongkam, and Thanyawut Krittikanon. We have been together for four years, forming a strong bond that enhances our collaborative efforts. We first met in high school, sharing the same class, and after some conversation, we discovered our similarities. For instance, we both share a passion for robotics and competition, which led us to join the YB-Robot club together. Much of what we know today has been learned from the experiences of our seniors, who have taught us valuable lessons and helped shape who we are now. This journey has brought us to this international stage.

   Last year, with great enthusiasm and spirits, we joined the WRO. Reaching the international round was already a great honor, but we were soon to realize that in order to win, one needs more than only enthusiasm. Our mistakes made us take the 8th position, a respectable position indeed. 

   This year we are back with more confident, and wiser from past experiences. We honed our strategies and prepared extensively. We fixed every mistake we have done last year and more. Being back at the international stage is one of our dream. And we are here to make everyone proud.

</p>


There are three members in our team, all extremely focused and dedicated to their positions, performing functions as follows: 
 
#### 1. Thanyawut Krittikanon – The Documentarian 
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Book2009/FE-NOC/blob/main/Team-Photos/Members/Thanyawut%20Krittikanon.png" width="400"/>
</p>
Thanyawut is in charge of documentation. He possesses both robotics and programming skills which helps him assist us in keeping our processes organized. He also ensures that every procedure and system we work on is accurately done correctly, helping us maintain a clear workflow. This will not only enable us to move forward to the next stage but to also improve on the stages we have gone through.

#### 2. Pawit Nateenantasawasd – The Programmer 
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Book2009/FE-NOC/blob/main/Team-Photos/Members/Pawit%20Nateenantasawasd.png" width="400"/>
</p>
This is Pawit, our talented coder. He may seem quiet at first, but his personality contributes to his work on coding “puzzles” in a very accurate and neat manner. It is his ability to focus which allows him to take up the challenge of programming very complicated systems like ours. It is this concentration that in the end enables us to have robots that work perfectly well. Pawit is always busy, it seems, and his engagement is what makes this group effective. 

#### 3. Pongpapat Putongkam – The Designer 
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Book2009/FE-NOC/blob/main/Team-Photos/Members/Pongpapat%20Putongkam.png" width="400"/>
</p>
We have Pongpapat, our resident robotic designer who is stereotypically imaginative. He was selected for this role due to his ability to form ideas quite literally out of nothing, which is often facilitated by short period of meditation. Because he can picture the idea of the design in his mind, it is easy to take the ideas and put it into a design that is eye catching and unique.  

</p>

### **Our Goal And Passion**

Our goal is to create a robot that can operate similarly to a self-driving car, with the hope of integrating it with an actual automobile. This is the first step toward our future goal of helping our country and inventing new things. Additionally, via participating in this competition, we have developed and learned numerous skills like collaboration, imagination, and foresight. We also desired to meet new friends from other nations in order to exchange cultures. Furthermore, we intend to utilize the experience we have obtained from this tournament to better ourselves and mentor our junior at school.

### **Work Schedule**

We made a detailed working plan showing our devotion, cooperation, and planning capabilities. Such a plan will enable us to coordinate our time and resources effectively and efficiently in achieving our lofty pursuits.

  " <em>We’re a team; we work as a whole, think as though we have a hundred heads, and know each other as if we’ve been together for years. We’ve come together, gathered the hands of each member, and moved forward with one, united mind.</em> "

# **Part 2: MECHANICAL DESIGN**

### The Robot

Designing a robot for this competition can be a challenging task. It has to be compact, lightweight, durable, and equipped with all the necessary functions for this Future Engineers competition. The robot must have four wheels with steering on either front or rear wheels, making component selection important to build our robot. After we've chosen the required components, then we focus on how to put the part together effectively. We chose a 3D-printed part and spent significant time ensuring it fits within the size regulations. 

When designing our robot, we use a 3D modeling application called Blender. Getting the scale right is important since even a small mistake can cause parts not to interlock seamlessly. We also had to do some research to figure out the best filament to use. We discovered that ABS(Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) worked best for our robot. Once the design was complete, we printed the parts and assembled them with the other components to see the result. Green and red should not be use with the robot since it can confuse the camera in the process of performing its task as it the same color as obstacle. 

For the design, we placed the gyro around the middle-top of the robot to get the most accurate output, while the camera was positioned at the front of the gyro to detect objects quickly.

Our robot has two servos, one on the bottom front and one on the top front. The bottom front servo is used to steer the wheel. Then, we added a top servo that rotates our ultrasonic. We use an ultrasonic to keep our robot out of the wall. Finally, we place our motor at the bottom back of the robot, and to ensure that it drives both wheels at the back, we use a gear differential from Lego.


## Robot's Chassis

The robot chassis design consists mainly of the 3D printed parts, which provide a strong support for all the hardware and electronics devices. Each element is custom-designed to meet our specific requirements and interlocks seamlessly to create a lightweight yet resilient structure. Modification and extension of the orthotics and bambulab 3D-printed chassis is made easily due to its modular construction. It is designed to house the motors, electronic circuitry, and battery while enhancing thermal management and balanced weight distribution for efficient operation. This strategy not only allows for fast modeling and changes in design, but it also makes it easy if an operational change requires that some parts should be removed or replaced with better ones as the robot matures.
