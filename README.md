# **Part 1: About Us.**

### **This is our team.**

 We are **Nocturnalist**. We are a team from Bangkok, Thailand. We Nocturnalists are what is called “night owls”. We work mainly at night because somehow our brains are active when the sky becomes pitch black. Our mascot, the owl, is also a symbol of wisdom and knowledge. It consists of the word "Nocturnal", which means animals well known for being active during nighttime, with the suffix "-ist" indicating someone who practices or specializes in something. Like us, we love to work during nighttime. 
 
 We are the third generation to use this name. The name Nocturnalist starts from our senior since the year 2015 in FLL Asia Pacific competition that took place in Australia. They won first place in both national and international stage.</p>
 This is our first generation to use this name.

   The team consists of three intimate friends Pawit Nateenantasawasd, Pongpapat Putongkam, and Thanyawut Krittikanon, our . We have been together for four years, developing a close attachment that positively affects our collaboration of working. 

   Last year, with great enthusiasm and spirits, we joined the WRO. Reaching the international round was already a great honor, but we were soon to realize that in order to win, one needs more than only enthusiasm. Our mistakes made us take the 8th position, a respectable position indeed 
   This year we will come back with more confident, and wiser from past experiences. We honed our strategies and prepared extensively.

There are three members in our team, all extremely focused and dedicated to their positions, performing functions as follows: 
 
1. Thanyawut Krittikanon – The Documentarian 
Standing on the left is Thanyawut who is the in charge of documentation. He possesses both robotics and programming skills which helps him assist us in ensuring we are in order. Thanyawut brings with him not only skills in the mechanical aspects of things but also in programming, which ensures recordings of our procedures. This will not only enable us to move forward to the next stage but to also improve on the stages we have gone through.

2. Pawit Nateenantasawasd – The Programmer 
In the middle is Pawit, our talented coder. He may seem quiet at first, but his personality contributes to his work on coding “puzzles” in a very accurate and neat manner. It is his ability to focus which allows him to take up the challenge of programming very complicated systems like ours. It is this concentration that in the end enables us to have robots that work perfectly well. Pawit is always busy, it seems, and his engagement is what makes this group effective. 

3. Pongpapat Putongkam – The Designer 
We have Pongpapat, our resident robotic designer who is stereotypically imaginative. He was selected for this role due to his ability to form ideas quite literally out of nothing, which is often facilitated by short period of meditation. Because he can picture the idea of the design in his mind, it is easy to take the ideas and put it into a design that is eye catching and unique.  

</p>

Our goal is to create a robot that can operate similarly to a self-driving car, with the hope of integrating it with an actual automobile. This is the first step toward our future goal of helping our country and inventing new things. Additionally, via participating in this competition, we have developed and learned numerous skills like collaboration, imagination, and foresight. We also desired to meet new friends from other nations. Furthermore, we intend to utilize the experience we have obtained from this tournament to better ourselves and mentor our junior at school.

Additionaly, we made a detailed working plan showing our devotion, cooperation, and planning capabilities. Such a plan will enable us to coordinate our time and resources effectively and efficiently in achieving our lofty pursuits.

  " <em>We’re a team; we work as a whole, think as though we have a hundred heads, and know each other as if we’ve been together for years. We’ve come together, gathered the hands of each member, and moved forward with one, united mind.</em> "

# **Part 2: MECHANICAL DESIGN**

Last year, our design was based entirely on Lego. This year we decided to up our game and 3d print the whole thing with ABS and PLA plastic filament reinforced with metal parts and some Lego. Using 3d printed parts allows more flexibility to be implemented and makes it easy to acquire spare parts for an emergency.
Even with all of that, we will still use Lego parts to connect in a very precise area.


## Robot's Chassis

The chassis of our robot, primarily constructed from 3D-printed components, forms a robust foundation for all hardware and electronics. Each part is custom-designed to meet our specific requirements and interlocks seamlessly to create a lightweight yet resilient structure. The modular design of the 3D-printed chassis allows for straightforward customization and scalability. It is engineered to accommodate motors, electronics, and the battery, ensuring proper heat dissipation and balanced weight distribution for optimal performance. This approach not only enables rapid prototyping and iterative design but also simplifies part replacement and upgrades as the robot evolves.
